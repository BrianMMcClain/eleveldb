This directory contains compiler/linker/runtime capability tests.

Programs here test one of two things:

- Compile/link or not:
  to test basic compiler capabilities or the presence of system-specific
  header files or library symbols

- Run successfully or not:
  to test whether some compiler/library feature behaves as expected

These are used ONLY to determine how to build this package, none of the test
code is part of the resulting package.

C files are generally legal C++, and are symlinked as such, to keep
compilers happy.
